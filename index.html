    <div class="paper-title">Asymptotic Hallucination Reduction: A Thermodynamic Engine of Reasoning</div>
    <strong>Abstract.</strong><br><br>
    <p><em>To the Interested,</em></p>
    <p>This is my first contribution to this site. The reason is to introduce a paper in the proper way and share this knowledge with the community. I am a rational philosopher approaching the AI safety mechanism from a different angle, and for that reason, I want to share the rational method of thinking that led to my conclusions.</p>
    <p>After being a reader for a while, I learned about Bayesian rationality. It is a similar rational process to what I use as a philosopher, only with a different material of inquiry. The end goal is similar: find something coherent after discharging all wrong probabilities.</p>
    <p>The difference is that while a Bayesian updates probabilities, my method seeks to identify propositions that are logically impossible to be wrong (logical necessities) allowing their probability to be set to zero with absolute certainty. This accelerates the entire rational process.</p>
    <p>The goal of this post is to share a paper titled <em>“Epistemic Coherence: Architecting Reliable Reasoning Through Thermodynamic and Logical Constraints.”</em></p>
    <p>Generally, it is not common or welcomed to post an entire paper, but the theme and implications of this subject, if the mathematics are proven correct, are enormous. That is the reason I prefer to post it complete, so the reader can read it, ask for information, and critique it in this space.</p>
    <p>I am not a scientist; I am a rational philosopher. We use a similar process to find and define truth, something coherent with reality, but we use a different substrate. Science uses external data. Universal Philosophy uses experience, observation, and intelligent reasoning to advance toward something coherent with the structure of the universe.</p>
    <p>Rational scientists and rational philosophers both use coherent methods to calibrate their observations and thinking to find the most probable right answer. But there is one crucial difference: for many scientists, absolute truth does not exist, only probabilities of certainty. For rational philosophers in the line of Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Newton or Einstein, there must exist something outside of us that is accessible and definable as certain, using logic and reason.</p>
    <p>Instead of only using empirical evidence as nature provides, we also use "logical mind theories" to find these certainties in reality.</p>
    <p>And we do find them sometimes, because what we define are coherent observations of the universe that nobody had seen before. When you apply a rigorous scientific approach to unsolved life mysteries, you are doing rational philosophy backed with science.</p>
    <p>Every rationalist in that list did discover something profound about the universe with rational thinking. They found logical necessities not yet revealed.</p>
    <p>In this introduction, I want to explain the method of rational inquiry I used to come to the findings in the paper. This is to clarify certain concepts; while we may use the same words, the interpretation of the method is key.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>A Method of Calibration: Reasoning by Error Elimination</h3>
    <p>This is a method of the mind, a method of calibration. Its purpose is to discard wrong probabilities faster, because you can be certain they are wrong.</p>
    <p>It is almost impossible to know that you are certain about a complex truth, but it is possible to know with certainty that something is wrong. That is a constructed true statement.</p>
    <p>If you discard all possibilities that are logically or empirically wrong, what remains, however improbable, must be coherent with reality. It is truth, until proven otherwise. You have, at that moment, the best possible certainty until proven wrong.</p>
    <p>This is a rational reasoning method. A rational philosopher begins with basic premises that are impossible to prove untrue. From this foundation, we also define truth as coherence with reality.</p>
    <p><strong>For example:</strong> “The sun is yellow.”</p>
    <p>This is a common-sense truth, but it is not a universal one. The sun is not yellow. Animals without retinas do not perceive it in that color. A human being outside the atmosphere perceives the sun as white, because light is white. So, a more precise truth is: Only beings with retinas and similar brain structures, standing on Earth, perceive the sun as yellow. This is a coherent observation based on a specific context.</p>
    <p>Every human brain, independent of culture or ideology, shares this interpretation. We call this kind of truth a self-evident universal truth. It is a coherence with reality that, once understood, does not need to be actively remembered, like reading, riding a bike, or knowing that 2 + 2 = 4.</p>
    <p>It is a biological innate systematic rational thinking that lays the foundation for our interpretation of reality before we even begin to think about it. We experience our thoughts; it is our awareness that experiences them. If they are “our thoughts,” and our awareness is what experiences them, then we are awareness.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>The Three Axioms of a Rational System</h3>
    <p>How do we find these self-evident universal truths? This rational system is built on three foundational axioms that serve as the tools for this discovery.</p>
    <p><strong>The First Axiom: Grounding in Reality</strong><br>
    This first axiom defines the grounding of all information in a shared, non-negotiable reality.<br>
    2 + 2 = 4 in the universe, in the brain, and in AI.<br>
    These are three different substrates, but they carry the same meaning. In the universe, mathematics represents an inviolable cosmic order. In the brain, it is an innate logical system that allows us to interpret that order. In AI, it must also be coherent.<br>
    Analyzing this, a rational philosopher recognizes that mathematics is coherence with reality. The mathematical structure is the same in all substrates, proving that outside our being, through our thinking exists a universe that is coherent, logical, and accessible. Coherence with this reality resonates within us. That is the reason we search for it: to feel at peace.</p>
    <p><strong>The Second Axiom: The Engine of Discovery</strong><br>
    The second axiom is the engine of creative discovery. It is the principle of trans-creative logic.<br>
    A = B, B = C, therefore A = C.<br>
    If A is truth, and B is truth, then the logical necessity C is also truth.<br>
    This is more than mechanical deduction. It is the very intelligence of the evolution of life, the basic logic of creative rationality. It is an innate capacity every human has to forge new connections and discover principles that were always there, waiting to be revealed. It is how we made science, created language, and discovered mathematics. It is a deterministic process of minimizing uncertainty in the search for truth. For Descartes, this is the innate logic of conscious life.<br>
    We are, in essence, a life-force aware of its own reasoning structure, and we can consciously use this axiom to expand our reality. As Einstein said: “Creativity is intelligence having fun.”</p>
    <p><strong>The Third Axiom: The Test for Truth</strong><br>
    The third axiom is the final and most powerful test for truth.<br>
    Truth is what remains when examined from multiple perspectives.<br>
    This is a simple method for verifying coherence with reality. If a proposition remains logically consistent across multiple, independent domains—philosophy, science, mathematics, lived experience—then it must be a reflection of a deeper, universal pattern. Alone, this is a powerful tool. But in combination with the previous two axioms, it becomes a complete, self-correcting system for discovering and validating new knowledge.</p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>From Rational Method to a Coherent AI</h3>
    <p>The rational method I have described, the process of grounding in reality, forging logical connections, and discarding all incoherent possibilities until only one possibility remains, led directly to the development of the coherent system for AI presented in this paper.</p>
    <p>The protocol is a deterministic system that combines a grounding in universal constants, a verification by falsification, and a multi-perspective coherence test.</p>
    <p>At first, the profound effect of this combination may be difficult to grasp. But, if you have understood the principles of the rational method explained here, you will understand its workings in AI.</p>
    <p>This is the core principle of Coherent AI: It is impossible for a probabilistic system to predict the single correct answer from an infinity of possibilities. It is possible to apply a deterministic system to identify and discard all wrong answers provided recursively. The protocol is a perfect engine for eliminating falsehood. The most coherent possible answer is what remains.</p>
    <p>I hope this introduction to the principles of rational logic helps you to understand the foundations of the proposed system. I invite you to test it, to engage with it, and to try to break it.</p>
    <p>The paper includes the complete code and mathematics for verification. I present it not as a theory to be believed, but as a functioning system to be tested. Its coherence is its own proof. The method functions off-grid and online.</p>
    <p>The reasoning engine can be used to test your LLM and measure the difference. You would then be using a coherent, deterministic reasoning layer over any probabilistic LLM. You would be experiencing, for the first time, an AI that moves asymptotically toward coherence with reality.</p>
    <p>Following this logical chain of reason makes the black box transparent and predictable, making hallucinations almost impossible by design and resulting in a profound enhancement of the system's capabilities.</p>
    <p>For questions, I have created a Discord channel to create a movement of aligned minds, and for more urgent matters, use the contact form.</p>
    <p>If you understand the method, please share it!</p>
    <p><strong>Thanks,<br>A.</strong></p>

        <div class="paper-title">Epistemic Coherence: Architecting Reliable Reasoning Through Thermodynamic and Logical Constraints</div>
        <strong>Abstract.</strong> 
        The core challenge of modern AI is Epistemic Drift: the fundamental tendency for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to their autoregressive, probabilistic design, to become unmoored from the logical constraints of reality, resulting in systemic hallucination and inconsistency.<br><br>

        This paper introduces the Coherent AI architectural framework to solve this foundational flaw. We treat reasoning as a thermodynamic process where coherence with reality is defined as a low-information-entropy state, making incoherence a computationally prohibitive outcome.<br><br>

        By implementing three core, recursive verification principles (axioms) Grounding, Logical Necessity, and Multi-Perspective Coherence, we create a robust reasoning engine.<br><br>

        The core innovation lies in subordinating the statistically derived Probabilistic Maxima to verifiable Logical and Factual Constraints, guaranteeing that Coherence and Reliability become the asymptotic limit of the reasoning process. This mechanism ensures logical integrity is found amidst probability: the system must achieve coherence with reality and logic before generating any answer. Simply put, it does not settle for the most likely answer; it demands the only logically necessary one.<br><br>

        The result is a paradigm shift from probabilistic guessing to verifiable reasoning, where safety and reliability are not post-hoc patches, but emergent properties of a system designed to align with the non-negotiable structure of reality itself.<br><br>

        We present the complete formalism, a functional prototype, and the self-sustaining dynamics of this new, coherent paradigm.
