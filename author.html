    <!-- Box 1: Introduction -->
    <div class="section-label">Introduction</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      <p>Hi, I'm Adriaan, a universal philosopher and author.</p>
      <p>I have developed a Universal Philosophy of Life and Love that combines these two fundamental forces into a coherent system, using a reasoning system of coherence with reality.</p>
      <p>It is based entirely on self-evident universal truths, my work bridges the infinite internal universe (our microcosmos) with the vast external universe (the macrocosmos) through the distinction between the ega and the ego.</p>
      <p>This philosophical framework reveals how these elements come together to form a complete human being in harmony.</p>
      <p>What makes this framework transformative is that, once understood, it fundamentally shifts how you perceive yourself and your place in the cosmos.</p>
      <p>To experience this transformation, you should read my book where I explore these principles in greater depth, and subscribe to the newsletters.</p>
      <p>All my essays and writing are connected to this framework.</p>
      <p>My book, A Theory About Everything: The Universal Philosophy of Life and Love, presents the foundation of this unifying framework, exploring the deep connections between the human microcosm and the vast cosmos.</p>
      <p>The book covers topics such as love, life, death, time, religion, sexuality, quantum physics, and the utopia of world peace, all woven together by a coherent theory.</p>
      <p>It is more than the usual philosophy book; it blends insights from science, spirituality, and my personal experience into a grand theory of reality's interconnected layers.</p>
      <p>From the subatomic to the infinite, I attempt to map out an empowering worldview of our place in the vastness of existence.</p>
      <p>Through my writings, I aim to inspire readers to step beyond rigid dogmas and embrace a courageous, all-encompassing personal philosophy rooted in truth.</p>
      <p>When I'm not exploring the depths of my universal philosophy in my mind, I can be found working on AI safety from a universal coherence with reality perspective. Translating the reasoning system of intelligence into functioning universal principles.</p>

    <!-- Box 2: Universal Philosophy -->
    <div class="section-label">Universal Philosophy</div>
    <div class="abstract">
      <p>My Universal Philosophy is more than just an academic subject; it is a way of life. It is not based on thinking, but rather on being. We are living beings, an experiencing life force, that knows is alive, that knows, it thinks, that knows it feels. We are awareness having a life experience.</p>
      <p>I believe in the power of three eternal and infinite processes: the acquisition of knowledge, the pursuit of truth, coherence with reality that resonates, and the search for beauty. And I believe in doing so with absolute freedom, always following my own heart and interests.</p>
      <p>Whether through working, art, or simply being, I dedicate myself to making the universe a more coherent and beautiful place.</p>

        <span class="action-title">Knowledge</span>
        <span class="action-description">I have always firmly believed in the importance of knowledge. The best way to acquire knowledge is through observation, experience, and reading. But to truly understand what we learn, we must put it into practice. Mastery, in my view, comes from explaining it to others.</span>

        <span class="action-title">Finding Coherence</span>
        <span class="action-description">The idea of truth has always fascinated me, and I believe that truth only exists in a universal way. The self-evident universal truth: the sun is yellow, 2+2 = 4. We all create the perception of the universe within our brains using the same logic, or truth.</span>

        <span class="action-description">Beauty is perception. Everything is beautiful, and everyone is beautiful… to someone. The most important thing is that you know you are beautiful. Beauty surrounds us every day and everywhere. You just have to take the time to appreciate it.</span>
